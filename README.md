# Retro Typing Bridge

This project enables the use of standard USB keyboards with vintage computers and PDAs.

By leveraging a low-cost CH582M development board ($3 on Aliexpress) and a TTL-RS232 converter board ($2), it translates the USB HID protocol into the Newton Keyboard serial protocol. This translation allows broad compatibility with numerous PDA operating systems, including:

- Palm OS
- Windows CE
- HP 200LX
- EPOC32
- Newton OS

This board also have rich GPIO and Bluetooth functionality, so there is a huge potential for other keyboard or mouse conversions, like USB->Bluetooth, USB->PS/2 or USB->ADB, or USB mouse->Serial mouse, but that would need more developers participate into it.
