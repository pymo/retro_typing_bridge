# Retro Typing Bridge
This project enables the use of standard USB keyboards with vintage computers and PDAs. 
By leveraging a low-cost CH582M development board, it effectively translates the USB Human Interface Device (HID) protocol into the Newton Keyboard serial protocol.

This translation allows broad compatibility with numerous PDA operating systems, including:

    Palm OS

    Windows CE

    HP 200LX

    EPOC32

    Newton OS
